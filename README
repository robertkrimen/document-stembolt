NAME
    Document::Stembolt - Read & edit a document with YAML-ish meta-data

VERSION
    Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
        my $content;
        $content = Document::Stembolt::Content->read_string(<<_END_);
        # vim: #
        ---
        hello: world
        ---
        This is the body
        _END_

        $content->preamble   "# vim: #\n"
        $content->header     { hello => world }
        $content->body       "This is the body\n"

DESCRIPTION
    This distribution is meant to take the headache out of reading, writing,
    and editing "interesting" documents. That is, documents with both
    content and meta-data (via YAML::Tiny)

    More documentation coming soon, check out the code and tests for usage
    and examples. This is pretty beta, so the interface might change.
